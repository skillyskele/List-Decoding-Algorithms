# List Decoding Algorithms

This is the code repository for Harry and Nathan's research project for Summer 2024.

We will be implementing industry-standard code to implement the decoding algorithm for List Decoding as proposed in [this paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3468265).

## Project Overview

- **src**: Contains main functions, currently including functions for verifying if a string is a synchronization string.
- **tests**: Contains unit tests implemented using the Unity testing framework.

## TODO

- Implement synchronization string generator.
- Review and optimize existing functions for improved functionality.
- Conduct time complexity analysis on functions to ensure they are optimal in comparison to the trivial O(N*log(N)) solution.
